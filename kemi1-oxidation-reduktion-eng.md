## Overview

This playlist is part of Magnus Ehinger's comprehensive Chemistry 1 (Kemi 1) course materials, focusing specifically on oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. The content is designed for Swedish high school students studying chemistry at the introductory level.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Fundamental Concepts

#### Oxidation
- **Definition:** The process where electrons are released (elektroner avges)
- A substance that loses electrons is said to be oxidized
- Example: Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻

#### Reduktion (Reduction)
- **Definition:** The process where electrons are taken up (elektroner upptas)
- A substance that gains electrons is said to be reduced
- Example: O + 2e⁻ → O²⁻

#### Redoxreaktion (Redox Reaction)
- **Definition:** A chemical reaction where both oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously
- Redox reaction = Oxidation + Reduction
- Electrons are transferred from one substance to another

### 2. Historical Context

**Original Definition:**
- Historically, oxidation meant a substance reacting with oxygen
- Reduction meant a substance releasing oxygen

**Modern Definition:**
- Oxidation = Loss of electrons
- Reduction = Gain of electrons
- This broader definition applies to many more chemical reactions

### 3. Oxidationsmedel och Reduktionsmedel

#### Oxidationsmedel (Oxidizing Agent)
- Substances that cause other substances to be oxidized
- The oxidizing agent itself becomes reduced
- Examples: Oxygen (O₂), chlorine (Cl₂), bromine (Br₂)

#### Reduktionsmedel (Reducing Agent)
- Substances that cause other substances to be reduced
- The reducing agent itself becomes oxidized
- Metals typically act as reducing agents

### 4. Oxidationstal (Oxidation Numbers)

- A system for tracking electron transfer in chemical reactions
- Used to identify which atoms are oxidized and reduced
- Rules for assigning oxidation numbers:
  - Pure elements have oxidation number 0
  - Monoatomic ions have oxidation number equal to their charge
  - In compounds, certain elements have typical oxidation numbers

**Key Principles:**
- **Oxidation:** Increase in oxidation number = electrons released
- **Reduction:** Decrease in oxidation number = electrons taken up

### 5. Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Magnesium and Oxygen
```
2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO
```
- Magnesium is oxidized: Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻
- Oxygen is reduced: O + 2e⁻ → O²⁻
- Magnesium acts as the reducing agent
- Oxygen acts as the oxidizing agent

#### Example 2: Sodium and Chlorine
```
2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl
```
- Sodium is oxidized: Na → Na⁺ + e⁻
- Chlorine is reduced: Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻
- This produces sodium chloride (table salt)

#### Example 3: Zinc and Hydrogen Chloride
```
Zn + 2HCl → H₂ + ZnCl₂
```
- Zinc is oxidized: Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻
- Hydrogen is reduced: 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂

### 6. The Electrochemical Series (Spänningsserien)

The electrochemical series ranks metals by their tendency to lose electrons:
- Metals high in the series are strong reducing agents
- They can reduce metals lower in the series
- Metals before hydrogen (H) can reduce H⁺ to H₂ gas
- Useful for predicting which redox reactions will occur spontaneously

### 7. Balancing Redox Reactions

Steps for balancing redox equations:
1. Identify oxidation numbers for all atoms
2. Determine which atoms are oxidized and reduced
3. Write separate half-reactions for oxidation and reduction
4. Balance electrons in both half-reactions
5. Combine the half-reactions
6. Cancel out electrons that appear on both sides

### 8. Types of Reactions

#### Always Redox Reactions:
- Combustion reactions
- Single replacement reactions
- Many combination/synthesis reactions
- Many decomposition reactions

#### Never Redox Reactions:
- Double replacement reactions
- Precipitation reactions
- Acid-base neutralization reactions

## Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:
- Define oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer
- Identify which substances are oxidized and reduced in a chemical equation
- Identify oxidizing agents and reducing agents
- Assign oxidation numbers to elements in compounds
- Use oxidation numbers to identify redox reactions
- Balance simple redox equations
- Use the electrochemical series to predict reactions
- Write half-reactions for oxidation and reduction processes
- Combine half-reactions to form complete redox equations

## Key Swedish-English Terminology

| Swedish | English |
|---------|---------|
| Oxidation | Oxidation |
| Reduktion | Reduction |
| Redoxreaktion | Redox reaction |
| Oxidationsmedel | Oxidizing agent |
| Reduktionsmedel | Reducing agent |
| Oxidationstal | Oxidation number |
| Elektroner avges | Electrons released |
| Elektroner upptas | Electrons taken up |
| Spänningsserien | Electrochemical series |
| Förbränning | Combustion |

## Important Concepts to Remember

1. **Electron Transfer is Central:** All redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one substance to another

2. **Simultaneous Processes:** Oxidation and reduction always occur together - you cannot have one without the other

3. **Opposite Changes:** The oxidizing agent is reduced while the reducing agent is oxidized

4. **Conservation:** The number of electrons lost in oxidation must equal the number gained in reduction

5. **Free Electrons Don't Exist:** In solution, electrons are immediately transferred from one species to another

## Study Tips

- Practice identifying oxidation numbers systematically
- Memorize the basic definitions: oxidation = electron loss, reduction = electron gain
- Use the mnemonic "OIL RIG" - Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain (of electrons)
- Work through many practice problems
- Understand the relationship between oxidizing/reducing agents and what they do vs. what happens to them
- Learn to use the electrochemical series as a tool for predictions
